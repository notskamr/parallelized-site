# Parallelized

Welcome to the official repository for 'Parallelized' - a code optimization and development competition (for [ShriTeq](https://shriteq.org)), created by Varun Sahni. The site for Parallelized is built using the Astro framework + TailwindCSS (nothing else has really been used excluding this except for some remark plugins).
