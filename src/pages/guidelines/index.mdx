## Overview
You work for a thriving ride-sharing company that connects hundreds of drivers with passengers daily. As part of your role, you need to determine which drivers deserve bonuses based on their performance over the last quarter. To make data-driven decisions in regards to the situation, you need to assess driver efficiency and pinpoint reasons for inefficiencies. Additionally, you want to incorporate a way to automate payout calculations that include bonuses for drivers doing well (in terms of efficiency and ratings). Lastly, you've been asked to find the overall customer satisfaction (average overall ratings across all rides), and which drivers are negative outliers in this regard (very low average ratings).

## Getting Started
Pleae clone this repository locally: https://github.com/parallelized/parallelized-starter. Your code should be available to see on GitHub so make sure to set up a repository for your submission!
Here's a helpful link to work with Git: [Git Cheatsheet](https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf)

## Understanding the Problem
Let's take a look at our file structure!
```bash
parallelized-starter/

│   ├── 2023-11-02.db         # SQLite database containing driver and ride data

```
We've been given a pretty simple structure - a SQLite database which contains driver data from the last quarter, a main script, and two files for functions needed for the task.
The SQLite database has two tables: `drivers` and `rides`. Let's go through a few rows of each.
1. `drivers`
![Drivers](/guidelines/assets/drivers.png)

2. `rides`
![Rides](/guidelines/assets/rides.png)

Please take a look through the columns of both tables and see what parameters we have! For today, our job is to implement 
7 main functions. `calculate_overall_customer_satisfaction`, `calculate_driver_effiency`, `analyse_driver_efficiency`, `calculate_driver_performance`, `calculate_payout`, `calculate_bonus` and `insert_analysis_row`
Along the way, you can implement any required helper functions as needed (some have been provided already in `database.py`)

## Task 1: Implement 'calculate_overall_customer_satisfaction'
`calculate_overall_custom_satisfaction` should get the average ratings over all rides for all drivers (average of ratings in the 'rides' table).

## Task 2: Implement 'calculate_driver_efficiency'
This function should analyse a driver's overall efficiency based on their average cost/km.
This value will be stored.

## Task 3: Implement 'analyse_driver_efficiency'
This function should analyse why these inefficiencies are occuring in the first place. There are three likely reasons that a driver could be inefficient.
1. They have a poor average cost/km with a specific vehicle (higher than Rs. 3 for 2 wheelers, higher than Rs. 6 for 3 wheelers, higher than Rs. 15 for 4 wheelers): "HIGHCOST"
2. They are very slow in terms of average speed across all rides (below 20km/h): "SLOW"
3. They have faced poor traffic: "TRAFFIC"
You should find which one of these three applies to each driver, and add to a comma-seperated string.
For eg. if a driver is poor average cost/km and poor traffic then it would be "HIGHCOST,TRAFFIC"
This string will eventually be stored. 

## Task 4: Implement 'calculate_driver_loyalty'
Loyalty is calculated on a scale of 1 to 5: lowest to highest. It is based on number of rides.
- Less than 200: 1
- Between 200-300: 2
- Between 300-400: 3
- Between 400-500: 4
- Above 500: 5

This will eventually be needed to calculate bonuses.

## Task 5: Implement 'calculate_paycheck'
Drivers are paid with a base fee of Rs. 50 with Rs. 10 per kilometer driven and Rs. 5 per minute driven. Calculate the total paycheck for each driver. This will eventually be stored.

## Task 6: Implement 'calculate_bonus'
Will be released soon.

## Task 7: Implement 'insert_analysis_row'
Will be released soon.

## Scoring
Implementations are based on functionality and speed.
