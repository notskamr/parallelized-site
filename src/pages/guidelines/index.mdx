## Overview
Your task is to create a library that implements optimized versions of two functions for [Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lempel–Ziv–Welch) lossless compression and decompression. Before you begin, please go through the pages linked in the [General](#general "General readings") section under Readings (at the bottom of the page).

## Task 1: Understanding the Problem
LZW compression is a type of lossless compression that works by
