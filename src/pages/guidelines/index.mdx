## Overview
Your task is to create a library that implements optimized versions of two functions for LZW lossless [image compression](lzw-compression "An overview of LZW compression") and [decompression](lzw-decompression "An overview of LZW decompression"). Before you begin, please go through the pages linked in the [General](#general "General readings") section under Readings (at the bottom of the page) to fully understand the way the competition works and for helpful resources.
