Hopefully, it has been a fun and educational experience for everyone who participated. Here are the top 3 teams and their respective runtimes:

1. The Shri Ram School, Moulsari: ~7 minutes
2. Ryan International School, Sohna Rd: ~13 minutes
3. Vasant Valley School: ~17 minutes

_(these are the runtimes for all 6,542 drivers being analysed with 677,822 rides!)_
