## Overview
You work for a thriving ride-sharing company that connects hundreds of drivers with passengers daily. As part of your role, you need to determine which drivers deserve bonuses based on their performance over the last quarter. To make data-driven decisions in regards to the situation, you need to assess driver efficiency and pinpoint reasons for inefficiencies. Additionally, you want to incorporate a way to automate payout calculations that include bonuses for drivers doing well (in terms of efficiency and ratings). Lastly, you've been asked to find the overall customer satisfaction (average overall ratings across all rides), and which drivers are negative outliers in this regard (very low average ratings).

## Getting Started
Please fork this repository: https://github.com/parallelized/parallelized-2023-starter.
Here's a helpful link to work with Git: [Git Cheatsheet](https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf)

## Understanding the Problem
Let's take a look at our file structure!
```bash

```
We've been given a pretty simple structure - a SQLite database which contains driver data from the last quarter, a main script, and two files for functions needed for the task.
The SQLite database has two tables: `drivers` and `rides`. Let's go through a few rows of each.
1. `drivers`
![Drivers](/guidelines/assets/drivers.png)

2. `rides`
![Rides](/guidelines/assets/rides.png)

Please take a look through the columns of both tables and see what parameters we have! For today, our job is to implement 
8 main functions. `calculate_overall_customer_satisfaction`, `calculate_driver_effiency`, `analyse_driver_efficiency`, `calculate_driver_performance`, `calculate_driver_loyalty`, `calculate_payout`, `calculate_bonus` and `insert_analysis_row`
Along the way, you can implement any required helper functions as needed (some have been provided already in `database.py`)

## Task 1: Implement 'calculate_overall_customer_satisfaction'
`calculate_overall_custom_satisfaction` should get the average ratings overall rides for all drivers (average of ratings in the 'rides' table).

## Task 2: Implement 'calculate_driver_efficiency'
This function should analyze a driver's overall efficiency based on their average cost/km.
This value will be stored.

## Task 3: Implement 'analyse_driver_efficiency'
This function should analyze why these inefficiencies are occurring in the first place. There are three likely reasons that a driver could be inefficient.
1. They have a poor average cost/km with a specific vehicle (higher than Rs. 2.7 for 2-wheelers, higher than Rs. 3.6 for 3-wheelers, higher than Rs. 15 for 4-wheelers, and higher than Rs. 8 for other): "HIGHCOST"
2. They are very slow in terms of average speed across all rides (below 20km/h): "SLOW"
3. They have faced poor traffic (the majority of their rides are 'POOR' or 'VPOOR' - consider a 50/50 split poor): "TRAFFIC"
You should find which one of these three applies to each driver, and add to a comma-separated string.
For eg. if a driver is poor average cost/km and poor traffic then it would be "HIGHCOST,TRAFFIC"
This string will eventually be stored. 

## Task 4: Implement 'calculate_driver_performance'
The average ratings of a driver should be calculated. This will eventually be needed to calculate bonuses.

## Task 5: Implement 'calculate_driver_loyalty'
Loyalty is calculated on a scale of 1 to 5: lowest to highest. It is based on the number of rides.
- Less than 200: 1
- Between 200-300: 2
- Between 300-400: 3
- Between 400-500: 4
- Above 500: 5

This will eventually be needed to calculate bonuses.

## Task 6: Implement 'calculate_paycheck'
Drivers are paid with a base fee of Rs. 50 with Rs. 10 per kilometer driven and Rs. 5 per minute driven. Calculate the total paycheck for each driver. This will eventually be stored.

## Task 7: Implement 'calculate_bonus'
An additional bonus is given as a portion of their total costs for the quarter (up to a limit of 65% of their costs). The function should return the bonus value in rupees. It is calculated as per their loyalty, performance, and efficiency.
1. Loyalty to the percentage of cost added to total bonus &rarr; 5: 30%, 4: 20%, 3: 15%, 2: 2.5%, 1: 0% (Eg. a loyalty of 5 with a total cost of Rs. 1200 means that Rs. 360 is added as a bonus)
2. Performance &rarr; >=4.5: 20%, >=3: 10%, Else: None
3. Efficiency &rarr; if 'SLOW' or 'HIGHCOST' are in their analysis, then there is no bonus given. If no inefficiencies, 10% bonus. If there is only high traffic, a 5% bonus.

## Task 8: Implement 'insert_analysis_row'
Let's take a look at the below snippet from the table schematic for 'driver_analyses', which is the table that you will work with while implementing this function.
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS driver_analyses (driver_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL, averageSpeed REAL NOT NULL, inefficiencyReason TEXT, payout REAL NOT NULL, bonus REAL NOT NULL);
```
Go through the fields in this table. Your function should insert a new row into the SQLite table 'driver_analyses'. Pretty straightforward: just a bit of tying stuff together!

## Tying It All Together (5% Bonus Score)
You've made all these functions. Now it's time to tie it all together! In 'main.py', correctly insert a row with all the required fields (you just made a function to help you with this!) for every single driver.
Take a look at the 'drivers' table and make sure that there is a row for all the drivers (check the row counts).

## Time to Optimize!
Optimize what you've done so far as well as you can!

## Time Yourself
You can time yourself and your implementations with the in-built Python library `time`. Here's an example that times calculate_bonus for a certain driver.
```python
# Let's assume that your implementation of calculate_bonus takes in a driver_id as its only argument, we can time it as below.

# Importing your calculate_bonus function
from metrics import calculate_bonus

# Importing the required functions from the time library
from time import time, process_time

# Take start time and CPU time
start_time = time()
start_cpu_time = process_time()

# Run the function n times (20 in this case) to account for possible variations in run-by-run time
for i in range(20):
    calculate_bonus(123)

# Get ending time and CPU time
end_time = time()
end_cpu_time = process_time()

print(f"Time taken: {end_time - start_time}")
print(f"CPU Time taken: {end_cpu_time - start_cpu_time}")
```
