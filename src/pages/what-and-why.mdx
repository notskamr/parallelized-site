## what is _parallelized?_

<span class="child:!mb-0 child:!mt-0">
  *parallelized* is a code optimization competition (by The Shri Ram School,
  Moulsari for the premier tech event, ShriTeq) where you optimize code in a way
  that your **software** can actually take advantage of the **hardware**. Teams
  compete to achieve the maximum possible speedup (over a very naive staff
  implementation) within three hours! There are teams of two and whichever team
  achieves the highest speed-up multiple, wins.
</span>

- Each team is assigned the same tasks and must complete all tasks
- Teams must first develop the tasks themselves and then optimize them to achieve the highest speedup multiple _(in Python)_
- All problem guidelines must be followed and all tasks must be completed
- The guidelines contain details about the elements of the program that must be implemented for correctness (eg. required functions, classes)
  - <p class="!text-xs">
      &gt;= **Note:** Local tests check for correctness and speedup. However,
      the speedup multiple may not be indicative of the speedup used for scoring
      due to discrepancies in the hardware used for testing and your systems -
      thus, it is better if you use the local speedup as a gauge for
      performance.
    </p>

## why _parallelized?_

<span class="child:!mb-0 child:!mt-0">
  With Moore's law slowing down, the need for speed within systems is greater
  than ever. This requires us to focus on code optimization and parallelism.
  Harnessing parallelism through techniques like multithreading,
  multiprocessing, and vector-based operations is crucial for performance gains.
  However, Amdahl's Law can limit speedup by preventing the parallelization of
  serial code elements. Thus, efficient code optimization, utilizing elements
  like caching and virtual memory, is also essential.
</span>

Enter _parallelized_, a 3-hour challenge to achieve maximum speedup in an application.

In the real world, code optimization and parallelism hold immense significance. Consider supercomputers like [Fugaku](https://w.wiki/m$u), that are optimized for parallelism, powering research in fields like medicine, climate change, and COVID-19 response. Like Fugaku, most modern computers, including supercomputers, leverage parallelism through multiple CPU cores. Code optimization is equally vital, exemplified by the constantly improved performance and security of the Linux kernel.

However, these optimizations truly shine on a large scale, impacting systems with thousands of concurrent operations, such as supercomputers and operating systems. For the average developer, optimizing a Python script from 10 seconds to 5 seconds might not make a noticeable difference. Python's [GIL (Global Interpreter Lock)](https://realpython.com/python-gil/) further limits true multithreading. Nevertheless, learning these skills remains essential, given their real-world importance.

_parallelized_ offers a fun and competitive way for students to learn and apply these critical concepts in practical scenarios.
