## what is _parallelized?_
<span class="child:!mb-0 child:!mt-0">
*parallelized* is a code optimization competition created by The Shri Ram School, Moulsari for the premier tech event, ShriTeq - one where you optimize code in a way that your **software** can actually take advantage of the **hardware**.
Teams compete to achieve the maximum possible speedup (over a very naive staff implementation) within three hours, offline! There are teams of two and whichever team
achieves the highest speed-up multiple, wins.
</span>

- Each team is assigned the same tasks and must complete all tasks
- Teams must first develop the tasks themselves and then optimize them to achieve the highest speedup multiple *(in Python)*
- All problem guidelines must be followed and all tasks must be completed
- The guidelines contain details about the elements of the program that must be implemented for correctness (eg. required functions, classes)
  - <p class="!text-xs">&gt;= **Note:** Local tests check for correctness and speedup.
  However, the speedup multiple may not be indicative of the speedup used for scoring 
  due to discrepancies in the hardware used for testing and your systems - thus, it is better if you use the local speedup as a gauge for performance.</p>

## why _parallelized?_
<span class="child:!mb-0 child:!mt-0">
With the slowdown of Moore's law, it is more important than ever for us to find other ways to achieve speedup within a system - therein lies code optimization and parallelism. Nowadays, we must try to take advantage of parallelism to the best of our abilities within our programs so that we can gain performance; commonly done through multithreading, multiprocessing, and vector-based operations. However, this is where Amdahl's Law limits our ability to speed up by not allowing serial elements of code to be parallelized. As a result, code must also be optimized to run as efficiently as possible by utilizing elements such as caching and virtual memory through our code. Presenting, Parallelized; a 3-hour race to achieve the highest possible speedup in an application.

Practically speaking, code optimization and parallelism are very important in the real world. In fact, the world's fastest supercomputer, Fugaku, is a supercomputer that is optimized for parallelism and is used for research in fields such as medicine, climate change, and energy. It is also used to help fight COVID-19. In addition, code optimization is also very important in the real world. For example, the Linux kernel is constantly being optimized to improve performance and security. In fact, the Linux kernel is one of the most optimized pieces of software in the world. As a result, code optimization and parallelism are very important in the real world and are very important skills to have.

However, it is important to note that most of these optimizations, although they make a difference, would only lead to real changes in efficiency at very large scales where thousands of operations need to be done all the time: such as in supercomputers or operating systems. But in the daily developer lives of most people, optimizing a Python script from 10 seconds to 5 seconds would not make a difference. Additionally, Python in itself is limited by its [GIL (Global Interpreter Lock)](https://realpython.com/python-gil/) which prevents true parallelism. However, it is still important to learn about these optimizations and parallelism as they are very important in the real world and are very important skills to have.

Parallelized aims to teach students about these optimizations and parallelism in a fun and competitive way, where they can learn and apply these concepts to real situations.
